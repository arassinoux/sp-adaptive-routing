# Adaptive Routing

_Alexandre Rassinoux - Semester Project - LIA EPFL_


This project presents a modular platform implemeted in Java, and capable of testing various [multi-armed bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) algorithms in parallel.
It includes the analysis of a set of stochastic, adversarial, and real-world scenarios with some reliable interpretations, by using multiple measure tools like expected reward. 

This project has been developed for the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (LIA) at EPFL.
